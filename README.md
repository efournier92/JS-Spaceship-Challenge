# JavaScript Spaceship Challenge 

This is a challenge I did to practice working with vanilla JS syntax. It build the metaphor of a space mission, with JS code pertaining to the preparation steps before blast off. 

####The code contained in `app.js` creates the following steps of the metaphor:
* Building a launchpad
* Building the spaceship
* Creating a crew
* Boarding the crew onto the ship
* Naming a captain
* Building the spaceship's rockets
* Mounting the rockets
* Fueling up
* Blasting off
* Running countdown sequence
